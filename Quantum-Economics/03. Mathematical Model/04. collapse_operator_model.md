# Collapse Operator Model  
## Mapping Identity Waves to Observable Economic Behavior

At decision time, identity collapses into an action state.

---

## Collapse Function

\[
\mathcal{C}(\Psi(t)) = |B_i\rangle
\]

Where \( |B_i\rangle \) is a basis vector representing one economic behavior:

- \( |S\rangle \): saving  
- \( |P\rangle \): spending  
- \( |R\rangle \): risk-taking  
- \( |I\rangle \): investing  

---

## Collapse Probability

\[
P(B_i) = |\langle B_i | \Psi(t) \rangle|^2
\]

This reproduces:
- consumer inconsistency  
- mood-based decisions  
- impulsive choices  
- irrational market reactions  

as **wave-probabilistic outcomes**, not “errors.”

---

## Collapse Triggers
Collapse happens when:

\[
|\Psi(t)| \rightarrow \text{threshold}
\]

triggered by:
- emotional overload  
- time pressure  
- external evaluation  
- conflict exhaustion  

---

## Key Insight
Behavior is a **measurement**, not identity itself.  
Economics currently models only the collapsed surface —  
this framework models the deeper wave-generators.
