# Cognitive Dissonance as Forced Collapse

Cognitive dissonance occurs when two or more persona-states  
cannot coexist in stable superposition.

\[
Conflict(Persona_i, Persona_j) \Rightarrow Forced\ Collapse
\]

This collapse generates **identity energy cost**, experienced as discomfort.

## 1. Forced Collapse Model

When two persona-states predict incompatible actions:

\[
Persona_i \nleftrightarrow Persona_j
\]

The system is forced to select one.

This reduces internal uncertainty abruptly → high psychological strain.

---

## 2. Causes

Dissonance arises when:

- values conflict with actions  
- self-image conflicts with behavior  
- moral standards conflict with social roles  
- identity expectations conflict across groups  

---

## 3. Formal Expression

\[
Dissonance\ Energy \propto \big| Prediction(Persona_i) - Prediction(Persona_j) \big|
\]

The greater the incompatibility,  
the greater the collapse cost.

## 4. Behavioral Outcomes

Common responses to forced collapse include:

- rationalization  
- avoidance  
- shifting beliefs  
- modifying behavior  
- compartmentalization  
- identity fragmentation

## 5. AI Implications

For AI systems, dissonance appears as:

- conflicting instructions  
- persona inconsistency across prompts  
- token-level contradictions  
- hallucinations under incompatible constraints  

Understanding dissonance in both humans and AI  
helps build more stable identity architectures.
