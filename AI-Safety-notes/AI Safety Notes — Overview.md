# AI Safety Notes — Overview

This folder provides a compact, structured overview of critical AI Safety concepts  
and my personal modeling approach derived from:

- Identity Superposition Theory
- Memory Architecture & Attenuation Modeling
- Dialogical Safety Protocols (DSP)
- Ethical Gradient Descent Framework (EGD)

### Purpose
To present a clear and accessible summary of:

1. Core risks of frontier models  
2. Alignment strategies  
3. Safety protocols  
4. Long-horizon governance considerations  
5. My proposed computational philosophy contributions

This serves as a quick-entry reference for anyone reviewing my portfolio or research work.
