# Identity Wave Function Model  
## A Formal Expression of Identity Evolution

We define the identity wave as:

\[
\Psi(t) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\psi_1(t) \\ 
\psi_2(t) \\ 
\vdots \\ 
\psi_n(t)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Each component represents a latent identity mode (e.g., saver, spender, risk-taker).

## Governing Equation

We model identity evolution using a Schrödinger-style equation:

\[
\frac{d\Psi(t)}{dt} = H(t)\Psi(t)
\]

Where **H(t)** is the *Identity Hamiltonian*, determined by:

\[
H(t) = H_0 + E(t) + C(t)
\]

- \( H_0 \): baseline personality structure  
- \( E(t) \): emotional potential  
- \( C(t) \): contextual influence  

This yields continuous, smooth evolution of identity over time.

## Interpretation
- Identity is **not static**  
- Identity is **not random**  
- Identity evolves *deterministically* until collapse is required  

This forms the mathematical backbone of the entire theory.
