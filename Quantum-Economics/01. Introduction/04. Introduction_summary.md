# Introduction Summary  
This chapter introduces the central idea of Quantum Economics:

> Human identity behaves like a wave—  
> and economic decisions are expressions of that wave.

Because identity is probabilistic:
- Preferences fluctuate  
- Risk tolerance changes  
- Behavior becomes uncertain  
- Economic patterns form oscillations

Classical economics cannot explain this because it assumes:
- stable preferences  
- rational consistency  
- deterministic response to incentives  

Quantum Economics restructures economic theory  
around psychological uncertainty and identity fluctuation.

The rest of the repository builds on this foundation.
