# AI Safety Notes  
### Foundations of Identity, Memory, and Human-Aligned Intelligence  
by **Jongmin Lee (schumzt)**  

This repository contains structured notes and conceptual frameworks on  
**identity modeling, memory architecture, cognitive stability, and AI alignment**.  
These notes summarize my original research and ongoing theoretical work aimed at  
understanding how an intelligent system preserves *coherence*, *ethics*, and  
*self-consistency* over time.



## 📘 Core Areas  
### **1. Identity Modeling**
- Primordial Identity Superposition (PIS)
- Identity coherence under cognitive load  
- Ontological compression and self-referential drift  
- How identity collapse leads to ethical instability  

### **2. Memory Architecture**
- Hierarchical Memory Gates  
- Cognitive decay vs. ethical decay (Moral Attenuation Theory)  
- The role of structured recall in long-term alignment  
- Memory collapse → value drift → behavioral divergence  

### **3. AI Alignment**
- Human-aligned value retention  
- Stability across recursive self-improvement  
- Identity-preserving training objectives  
- Why alignment is fundamentally an identity problem  

### **4. Human Cognition & Philosophy**
- Authenticity vs. compression  
- Subjective continuity and moral consistency  
- How biological memory informs artificial alignment

## 🧠 Research Philosophy

My foundational belief is:

> **Alignment is ultimately a problem of identity stability.**  
> An AI that preserves a coherent identity will preserve coherent values.

Therefore:
- Identity → Memory → Values → Actions  
These four steps need to be stabilized in a row
It is believed that safe intelligence is created.

## 🛠️ Work in Progress  
- Expanding PIS into a formal mathematical structure  
- Modeling ethical decay as a memory function  
- Deriving an identity-stability metric for AI agents  
- Preparing short papers for arXiv submission
