# 🌌 Quantum Economics: Identity as a Wave

**Quantum Economics** is an emerging framework proposing that  
economic behavior is not driven by fixed preferences,  
but by **probabilistic identity states**—  
a psychological wave function that fluctuates across contexts.

Just as quantum systems exhibit uncertainty between position and momentum,  
humans oscillate between different internal identity states,  
producing economic patterns that classical models cannot fully explain.

## 🧠 Core Claim

> **If identity is probabilistic, then economics might be quantum —  
> not metaphorically, but structurally.**

Identity is modeled not as a stable preference,  
but as a *wave*: shifting, collapsing, and re-emerging  
depending on role, environment, and psychological state.

## 🌊 Why This Framework Matters

Current economic models assume stable preferences  
and rely almost entirely on **transaction data**.

But human decisions are shaped by  
internal, fluctuating psychological states — the **Identity Wave**.

If we want AI Agents that truly understand human markets,  
they must model this wave, not just observable behavior.

## 🧩 Key Features of Quantum Economics

- Models *identity* as a dynamic wave function  
- Introduces psychological uncertainty as structural, not noise  
- Explains cyclical behavior (consumption, risk-taking, business cycles)  
- Bridges quantum mechanics, psychology, macroeconomics, and AI  
- Provides a new foundation for human–AI market interaction
