# Future Work

Several directions naturally extend the Identity Uncertainty Principle.

---

## 1. Multi-Persona Distribution Model

\[
\sum_i (\Delta T_i \cdot \Delta A_i) \ge K
\]

Identity stability may depend on the total uncertainty budget across personas.

---

## 2. Identity Entropy

Define entropy of identity states:

\[
H = - \sum_i p_i \log p_i
\]

Used to quantify identity diffusion or over-stability.

## 3. Empirical Testing

Potential datasets:

- behavioral variability  
- moral decision divergence  
- role-change performance  
- LLM persona drift  

---

## 4. AI Architecture Design

- stable core-persona layers  
- context-gated persona activation  
- memory-based identity weighting  
- conflict-resolution modules  

---

## 5. Psychological Modeling

- trauma as low-entropy identity collapse  
- ADHD variability as elevated ΔT  
- compulsive behavior as reduced ΔA  
- mood disorders as unstable collapse dynamics  

---

## 6. Philosophical Extensions

- collapse and free will  
- identity continuity over time  
- moral responsibility and uncertainty  
- existential interpretations of ΔT and ΔA
