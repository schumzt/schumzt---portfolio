# Identity–Memory Interaction Models

Identity and memory form a tightly coupled adaptive loop.

---

## 1. Identity Shapes Memory Activation
At any moment, “who you are” determines:
- Which memories activate
- Which interpretations you accept
- Which narratives feel coherent

Identity acts as a global biasing function.

---

## 2. Memory Shapes Identity
Every act of remembering subtly rewrites identity by:
- Updating internal narratives  
- Reinforcing a self-model  
- Reweighing personal meaning structures  

---

## 3. Feedback Loop Dynamics
Identity biases memory; memory rewrites identity.

This recursive loop explains:
- Sudden shifts in self-understanding  
- Stability of personal narratives  
- The difficulty of escaping identity-bound thinking

## 4. AI Influence on the Loop
AI tools amplify or suppress memory clusters.
Thus AI systems actively participate in identity construction.
