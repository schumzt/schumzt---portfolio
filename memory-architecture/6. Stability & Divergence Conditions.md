# 6. Stability & Divergence Conditions

Memory stability and divergence describe how cognitive systems maintain coherent identity—or fragment into competing states—under varying contextual, emotional, and semantic pressures.

This section formalizes the conditions under which a memory network remains stable, transitions to a new state, or diverges into chaotic patterns.

## 6.1 Activation Stability Condition

A memory system is stable when small perturbations do not cause runaway activation.

Formally:

\[
\left| \Delta M(t) \right| < \epsilon
\quad \text{whenever} \quad
Input(t) < \tau
\]

Where:

- **ΔM(t)** = change in memory activation vector  
- **ε** = stability bound  
- **τ** = perturbation threshold (internal/external stimuli)  

Stability ensures:

- consistent recall  
- minimal distortion  
- predictable reasoning  
- resilient identity state

## 6.2 Conditions for Divergence

A system diverges when activation changes amplify over time:

\[
\left| \Delta M(t+1) \right| > \left| \Delta M(t) \right|
\]

Divergence occurs under the following conditions:

### (a) **High Emotional Load**
\[
Emotion(t) > \lambda
\]

Leads to:

- exaggerated recall  
- bias amplification  
- loss of neutral interpretation  

### (b) **Goal Conflict**
\[
Sim(G_1, G_2) < 0
\]

Competing goals destabilize the contextual field, causing:

- contradictory memories  
- fragmented reasoning  
- unstable attention  

### (c) **Contextual Discontinuity**
Rapid environmental changes break narrative continuity:

- mismatched cues  
- context switching  
- shallow integration  

### (d) **Semantic Overload**
When too many memories activate simultaneously:

\[
|A(t)| > A_{\text{capacity}}
\]

Results in:

- confusion  
- disorganized thought  
- impaired retrieval

## 6.3 Divergence Pathways

Divergence can manifest in three pathways:

### 1. **Chaotic Activation**
Nonlinear jumps between unrelated memory nodes.  
Symptoms:

- fragmented recall  
- “noise-like” associations  
- unstable interpretation  

### 2. **Looping Activation**
Repetitive activation of a single pattern.  
Symptoms:

- rumination  
- obsessive focus  
- emotional reinforcement  

### 3. **Competing Narrative Frames**
Two or more narratives fight for dominance.  
Symptoms:

- ambivalence  
- self-doubt  
- contradictory reasoning

## 6.4 Stability Recovery Mechanisms

A system returns to stability through internal regulatory functions:

### (a) **Context Re-centering**
Re-aligning with consistent cues:
- familiar environments  
- predictable routines  
- semantic anchors  

### (b) **Goal Reintegration**
Coherence restored when goals are hierarchically ordered:

\[
G_{primary} \gg G_{secondary}
\]

### (c) **Emotional Down-Regulation**
Reduction of affective load:

- cognitive distancing  
- reflection  
- narrative re-evaluation  

### (d) **Semantic Pruning**
Inhibition of irrelevant activations:

- selective suppression  
- decay acceleration  
- narrowing of attention

## 6.5 Stability Metric (Proposed)

Define a stability score:

\[
S = 1 - \frac{\sigma(M)}{\sigma_{\text{max}}}
\]

Where:

- **σ(M)** = variance of activation across memory nodes  
- **σₘₐₓ** = divergence boundary  

Interpretation:

- **S ≈ 1.0** → high stability  
- **S ≈ 0.5** → unstable but recoverable  
- **S < 0.2** → divergence state  

---

## 6.6 Cognitive Interpretation

In human cognition:

- Stability → clarity, consistency, coherent identity  
- Divergence → confusion, emotional overwhelm, contradictory interpretations  

This mapping provides a computational explanation for:

- rumination  
- emotional spirals  
- memory distortion  
- identity instability  
- rapid narrative restructuring

## 6.7 Summary

Stability & Divergence Conditions define when the memory system holds a coherent structure, when it destabilizes, and how it recovers.  
They provide a foundation for modeling memory disorders, emotional reasoning, self-regulation, and adaptive learning in both biological and artificial agents.
