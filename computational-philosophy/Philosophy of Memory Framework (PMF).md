# Philosophy of Memory Framework (PMF)

A computational–philosophical model describing how memory is formed, stabilized, decayed, revived, and integrated into identity.  
PMF treats memory as an active, self-regulating cognitive architecture—not a passive storage system.

## 1. Overview

The **Philosophy of Memory Framework (PMF)** explains memory as a multi-layered cognitive engine with:

- **Structural persistence** (stable memory cores)  
- **Dynamic modulation** (emotional or contextual amplification)  
- **Reconstructive updating** (memory changes through re-access)  
- **Identity-binding** (memories define the ‘self’ across time)

PMF integrates neuroscience, phenomenology, computational modeling, and AI alignment concepts to describe how humans preserve continuity of identity.

## 2. Core Principles

### **2.1 Memory as Active Reconstruction**
Memory is not a replay system.  
Each recall is a partial **reconstruction**, influenced by:

- current goals  
- emotional states  
- contextual primes  
- self-narrative consistency

> *You never recall the past — you rebuild it.*

---

### **2.2 Memory as Self-Alignment Architecture**
Memories determine the continuity of the agent:

- Forming value gradients  
- Shaping predictions about the world  
- Supporting long-term coherence  
- Enabling stable intentions

Identity = the stable compression of one's memory architecture.

---

### **2.3 Memory as Compression**
The brain does not store literal experiences.  
It stores **compressed representations**, retaining:

- causal structure  
- emotional significance  
- patterns of prediction

This compression explains memory bias, forgetting, and narrative evolution.

---

### **2.4 Memory Stability vs Memory Plasticity**
Memory systems must balance:

- **Stability (S)** → resisting distortion  
- **Plasticity (P)** → enabling adaptation

The PMF defines an optimal ratio:
  
> Stability-to-Plasticity Ratio (SPR) = *S / P*

Agents with extreme SPR become either cognitively rigid or unstable.

## 3. The Five Memory Layers (PMF-L5)

PMF structures memory into **five interconnected layers**:

1. **Sensory Imprint Layer (SIL)**  
   - raw perceptual packets  
   - lasts milliseconds → seconds  

2. **Pattern Encoding Layer (PEL)**  
   - transforms sensory data into structured representations  

3. **Narrative Integration Layer (NIL)**  
   - combines memories into personal stories  
   - essential for identity  

4. **Emotional Modulation Layer (EML)**  
   - assigns emotional weight  
   - determines which memories survive  

5. **Long-Term Self Memory Layer (LSML)**  
   - repository of life-defining events  
   - slowest to change  
   - core to “who I am”  

---

## 4. Memory Decay & Reinforcement Model

Memory strength **M(t)** changes over time through:

### **4.1 Natural Decay**
\[
M_{t+1} = M_t \cdot \delta
\]
- \( 0 < \delta < 1 \)  
- Biological forgetting rate  

---

### **4.2 Reinforcement Through Recall**
\[
M_{t+1} = M_t + \rho \cdot A_t
\]
- \( \rho \): reinforcement coefficient  
- \( A_t \): activation intensity (emotional + cognitive)

---

### **4.3 Reconstructive Bias**
Each recall introduces small distortions:
\[
\Delta B_t = f(\text{emotion},\ \text{context},\ \text{identity-coherence})
\]

---

## 5. Identity Continuity Equation (ICE)

Identity continuity **C** emerges when memory compression and personal narrative align:

\[
C = \int (M_i \cdot N_i \cdot E_i)\,di
\]

Where:

- \( M_i \): memory strength  
- \( N_i \): narrative integration weight  
- \( E_i \): emotional salience  

High **C** = stable, coherent self  
Low **C** = fragmentation, dissociation, confusion

---

## 6. Predictive Role of Memory

Memory supports predictive functions:

- anticipating danger  
- forming interpersonal expectations  
- developing moral intuitions  
- constructing long-term plans  

PMF explains prediction as **memory-driven simulation**.

---

## 7. Implications for AGI Alignment

PMF provides tools to design AI systems with:

### **7.1 Memory Stability Mechanisms**
- preventing unintended drift  
- maintaining ethical constraints  

### **7.2 Identity Coherence Models**
- grounding long-term agent behavior  

### **7.3 Narrative Alignment**
AI must maintain stable narrative consistency across interactions.

---

## 8. Summary

The Philosophy of Memory Framework defines memory as:

- reconstructive  
- compressed  
- emotionally modulated  
- identity-binding  
- predictive  

By modeling memory computationally, PMF provides a foundation for designing coherent human and artificial agents.
