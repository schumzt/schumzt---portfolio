# Economic Wave Field Model  
## The Mathematics of Collective Psychological Markets

We define the market wave field as:

\[
\Phi(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N \Psi_i(t)
\]

This produces emergent interference patterns.

---

# 1. Constructive Interference  
If many agents share aligned emotional/psychological states:

\[
\Psi_i(t) \approx \Psi_j(t)
\]

Then:

\[
|\Phi(t)| \uparrow
\]

→ optimism rises  
→ spending ↑  
→ asset prices ↑  
→ bubbles can form

---

# 2. Destructive Interference

If agents have conflicting identity-phase:

\[
\langle \Psi_i(t), \Psi_j(t) \rangle < 0
\]

Then:

\[
|\Phi(t)| \downarrow
\]

→ uncertainty  
→ market freezes  
→ volatility increases

# 3. Phase-Shift Dynamics

Small emotional or contextual changes cause **phase shifts**:

\[
\Psi_i(t+\delta) = e^{i\theta} \Psi_i(t)
\]

leading to:
- sudden market reversals  
- collective mood swings  
- confidence collapses

# Insight
The economy is not a sum of rational choices.  
It is a **wave field**, shaped by billions of evolving identity waves.
