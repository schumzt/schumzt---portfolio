# Mathematical Assumptions  
## Foundations for a Formal Model of Quantum Economics

To construct a rigorous mathematical framework for identity and economic behavior,  
we define the following foundational assumptions:

---

## 1. Identity as a Continuous Wave Function
A person’s internal psychological structure is modeled as a wave:

\[
\Psi(t) \in \mathbb{C}^n
\]

Where:
- Each dimension corresponds to a potential identity mode  
- Magnitude encodes likelihood  
- Phase encodes internal alignment or conflict  

---

## 2. Behavioral Output as a Collapse
Behavior is not identity.  
It is the *collapsed projection* onto observable outcomes.

\[
\text{Behavior}(t) = \mathcal{C}(\Psi(t))
\]

where \( \mathcal{C} \) is a non-linear collapse operator.

---

## 3. Emotional and Contextual Fields
Identity is influenced by two external fields:

\[
E(t): \text{emotional field}, \quad C(t): \text{context field}
\]

Both act analogously to potentials in physics.

---

## 4. Economic Actions as State Transitions
Each economic behavior (spending, saving, investing)  
corresponds to a basis vector in decision-space.

\[
|B_i\rangle
\]

Identity collapses into one of these vectors at decision time.

---

## 5. Market as a Field of Interacting Waves
Economies are emergent fields created by N interacting agents:

\[
\Phi(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N \Psi_i(t)
\]

This produces interference patterns which manifest as market cycles.

---

These assumptions allow for a mathematically consistent model  
that bridges identity, psychology, and macroeconomic behavior.
