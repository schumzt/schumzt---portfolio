## 1. Overview
Primordial Identity Superposition proposes that a human identity is never a
single coherent vector but a superposition of multiple, context-sensitive
value vectors. Each vector corresponds to a latent moral preference,
affective orientation, or cognitive tendency.

The theory models identity as a high-dimensional value wavefunction:
\[
I = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k V_k
\]
where each \( V_k \) is a value-vector component, and \( \alpha_k \) is the
activation weight determined by context, memory states, and self-prior.

This framework explains:
- internal contradictions,
- memory attenuation,
- moral inconsistency,
- and identity shifts without invoking pathology.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Value Superposition
Identity is a superimposed set of competing value vectors, not a single axis.

### 2.2 Context-Triggered Collapse
Specific contexts cause partial or full “collapse” into dominant vectors.

### 2.3 Moral Weight Plasticity
Weights \( \alpha_k \) change over time via memory, experience, and
self-reflection.

### 2.4 Identity Drift
Long-term changes in baseline weights explain gradual personality evolution.

## 3. Cognitive Mechanisms

### 3.1 Memory Attenuation
Memory decay reshapes value weights, producing identity divergence.

### 3.2 Affective Interference
Multiple affective vectors interfere constructively or destructively.

### 3.3 Self-Prior Updating
Agents continuously update predictions of “who I am,” altering weight
distribution.

---

## 4. Mathematical Structure

### 4.1 Value Vector Space
Identity resides in a dynamic vector space \( \mathbb{V} \subset \mathbb{R}^d \).

### 4.2 Activation Function
\[
\alpha_k = f(M, C, H)
\]
M = memory  
C = context  
H = affective state  

### 4.3 Distance and Divergence
Identity drift is modeled as gradient flow on the manifold of value vectors.

## 5. Applications

### 5.1 AI Alignment
Humans do not have a single utility function; they have superposed moral
vectors. Alignment requires:
- predicting value activation patterns,
- modeling moral collapse events,
- and designing systems robust to identity inconsistency.

### 5.2 Memory-Based Preference Prediction
Identity is more stable when memory attenuation is minimized; instability
increases divergence.

### 5.3 Long-Term Trajectory Modeling
Superposition allows predicting long-term identity arcs using value-vector
dynamics.

## 6. Conclusion
Primordial Identity Superposition offers a unified theory linking identity,
memory, value dynamics, and alignment.  
It provides a blueprint for modeling real human preference structures and
designing safer AI systems aware of human value multiplicity.
