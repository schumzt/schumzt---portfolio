4. Identity Vector Integration (IVI)

4.1 Overview

Identity Vector Integration (IVI) describes the cognitive mechanism by which human memory systems construct, stabilize, and update the sense of “self” across time.
It provides a computational analogy for how episodic events, semantic abstractions, and emotional valences converge into a coherent, continuous identity vector.

In this framework, identity is not a static entity but a dynamic attractor state built from the ongoing integration of:

autobiographical memory

personal preferences

moral beliefs

long-term goals

emotional conditioning

contextual role schemas


IVI offers a unified explanation for how identity remains stable enough for continuity yet flexible enough to adapt to new experiences.




4.2 Core Components

Identity formation emerges from the interaction of three primary components:

1. Autobiographical Encoding (A)

Captures personally experienced events tied to:

time & place

actions taken

social interactions

emotional intensity

perceived meaning


Produces episodic identity traces, each storing a moment in the “story of self.”




2. Value-Laden Semantic Structures (V)

Long-term identity is shaped by meaning-bearing, generalizable abstractions:

moral values

cultural norms

self-concept schemas

personal narratives

learned beliefs about the world


These structures correspond to the “identity backbone” that influences future judgments and behaviors.




3. Emotional Modulation (E)

Emotion assigns weights to memories and beliefs:

increases retention strength

affects integration priority

influences future decision-making

reinforces or suppresses identity traits


Emotion serves as the gain control layer that amplifies or attenuates the importance of identity-relevant information.




4.3 Mathematical Representation

Identity Vector Integration can be formalized as:

I_t = \alpha A_t + \beta V_t + \gamma E_t

Where:

: identity vector at time t

: autobiographical contributions

: semantic-value contributions

: emotional modulation

: layer weights


Weights vary based on:

developmental stage

stress level

social context

cognitive capacity

recent reinforcement


To ensure stability:

||I_t - I_{t-1}|| < \delta

Where δ is the “identity drift tolerance.”




4.4 Integration Dynamics

A. Temporal Coherence

Past identity states constrain future states, making identity a Markov-like process:

I_t \approx f(I_{t-1}, A_t, V_t, E_t)

Ensures continuity and prevents fragmentation.




B. Conflict Resolution

When contradictory inputs arise:

semantic beliefs override episodic anomalies

emotionally intense events temporarily dominate

long-term coherence pushes system toward equilibrium


Identity seeks the lowest cognitive dissonance state.




C. Identity Plasticity Threshold (IPT)

Defines how easily identity can change:

Low IPT → identity is rigid

High IPT → identity is adaptive


IPT depends on:

cognitive openness

emotional resilience

trauma history

novelty exposure





4.5 Identity Stability Conditions

Identity remains stable under the following conditions:

low cumulative dissonance

sufficient semantic coherence

consistent reinforcement of core values

moderate emotional variance

regular integration of episodic events


If these are disrupted:

identity drift

fragmentation

sudden redefinition

maladaptive coping patterns
may occur.





4.6 Identity Divergence Conditions

Divergence occurs when:

emotional shocks exceed IPT

semantic structures collapse or contradict

overwhelming novelty disrupts coherence

autobiographical memory is inconsistent

social roles rapidly shift


This explains:

identity crises

major life turning points

personality reconstruction after trauma

self-concept breakdowns





4.7 Applications

1. Cognitive Science

IVI provides a unified model for:

lifelong identity development

personality stability

narrative self-construction

memory disorders and identity loss





2. AI & Alignment

Potential uses include:

constructing stable long-term identity states in AI agents

modeling preference drift

minimizing contradictory behaviors

ensuring interpretability of value systems





3. Clinical Psychology

Supports therapeutic methods that:

rewrite maladaptive identity narratives

integrate traumatic episodes

strengthen self-coherence

adjust emotional weighting





4.8 Summary

Identity Vector Integration presents a mathematically grounded, cognitively plausible model of identity construction.
Through the continuous merging of autobiographical events, semantic beliefs, and emotional weights, the mind generates a stable, coherent sense of self while retaining enough flexibility to adapt to new contexts.

This framework offers powerful tools for modeling human identity, diagnosing instability, and designing AI systems that maintain coherent long-term values.
