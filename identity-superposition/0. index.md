# Identity Superposition

A collection of theoretical, computational, and philosophical work exploring
how human identity behaves as a superposition of multiple value vectors,
cognitive states, and moral orientations. This directory introduces the core
framework, mathematical structures, and safety implications of identity
superposition.

## Included Papers
- **Primordial Identity Superposition** — Foundational theory describing identity as a multi-vector superposition field.
- **Mathematical Identity Model** — Formal structures for value-vector dynamics, self-prior updates, and attenuation.
- **Applications to AI Safety** — Implications for alignment, long-term identity prediction, and moral grounding.
