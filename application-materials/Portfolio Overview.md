# Portfolio Overview
**Jongmine Lee – Cognitive Systems, AI Safety, and Memory Architecture Research**

This portfolio documents the evolution of my research across cognitive architectures,  
human–AI co-evolution models, educational cognition, and foundational theories of reasoning.  
It serves as a unified index for my work across philosophy, AI safety, system design,  
and multi-modal intelligence.

## 1. Research Identity & Focus

### **Core Themes**
- **Memory Architecture & Meta-Cognition**
  - How internal narratives shape reasoning, decision-making, and identity
  - Structural modeling of human–AI co-memory systems
- **Self-Regulation Engine Models**
  - Mechanisms that define stable intelligence under uncertainty
  - Formal frames for emotional regulation and reflective cognition
- **Human–AI Co-Evolution Protocols (HACEP)**
  - Architectures for safe, mutually enhancing interactions between biological and artificial minds
- **Cognitive Minimalism**
  - Reducing complex tasks to fundamental cognitive primitives
  - Structural clarity as a form of intelligence

### **Primary Research Question**
**“How can memory, identity, and meta-cognition be engineered  
to produce stable, interpretable, and deeply aligned intelligence?”**

## 2. Major Documents

### **Research Statements**
- **Statement of Purpose**  
  A high-level overview of my research motivations, philosophical background,  
  and the long-term arc of my contribution to AI and cognitive systems.

- **Research Motivation Letter**  
  Documents the intellectual origin of my theories and the events that shaped my pursuit of AI research.

## 3. Core Theoretical Frameworks

### **(1) Memory Architecture Model (MAM)**
- Multi-layered memory structure (base memory → narrative cores → identity layer)
- Bidirectional reinforcement loops
- Reliability, compression, and coherence metrics

### **(2) Self-Regulation Engine (SRE)**
- Construct for analyzing emotional stability in intelligent systems  
- Formal parameters: disturbance tolerance, meta-stability, self-repair cycles

### **(3) Consciousness Architecture**
- A structured blueprint of awareness levels  
- Intentionality → Reflectivity → Self-Modeling → Recursive Insight

### **(4) HACEP – Human–AI Co-Evolution Protocols**
- Framework for safe, long-term symbiosis
- Co-learning, co-memory formation, and distributed cognition chains

### **(5) Cognitive Linearity Theory**
- How humans maintain direction in thought despite noise and emotional variance

---

## 4. Application-Oriented Work

### **Educational Cognition**
- High-efficiency learning frameworks  
- Skill acquisition and long-term retention optimization  
- Systematic study of “intelligence under pressure”

### **Philosophical Essays**
- Meaning, identity, continuity of self  
- Moral Attenuation Theory  
- Memory and narrative construction  
- Structure of human longing and the architecture of desire

---

## 5. AI Safety & Alignment

### Key Contributions
- Frameworks for stable self-regulating AI  
- Memory-based interpretability

## 7. Research Roadmap

### **Short-Term (0–6 months)**
- Publish core theories in formal formats  
- Develop structured documentation of Memory Architecture  
- Build GitHub-based research index

### **Mid-Term (6–18 months)**
- Release whitepapers  
- Create educational cognition experiments  
- Build interactive demos (memory compression, reasoning chains, etc.)

### **Long-Term (18+ months)**
- Establish original theory lineage  
- Collaborate with advanced AI labs  
- Produce a unified philosophical–technical framework bridging:
  - AI Safety  
  - Cognitive Science  
  - Philosophical Anthropology
