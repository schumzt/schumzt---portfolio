# A Computational Architecture for Dynamic Memory and Identity

This document formalizes how memory dynamics can be mapped onto
computational systems.

---

## 1. System Overview
Memory is modeled as a graph whose structure reorganizes with each recall event.
Nodes represent experiential fragments; edges represent meaning relations.

---

## 2. Retrieval as Re-Construction
Retrieval is an inference process, not recovery.
A “memory output” is the result of:
- Current identity state
- Active context index
- Internal graph topology at recall time
- AI-mediated information introduced into the system

---

## 3. Feedback Loops with Identity
Identity acts as a global parameter that biases memory activation.
Memory outputs modify identity, creating recursive loops.

This mirrors how large language models (LLMs) adapt based on conversation state.

## 4. Computational Extensions: AI as a Co-Constructor
Human–AI interaction changes:
- Salience weights  
- Meaning connections  
- Accessible clusters  

AI functions as:
- An external working memory  
- A contextual scaffold  
- A relevance re-weighting mechanism  

Thus, the architecture is hybrid: biological + computational.

## 5. Applications
- Designing AI that adapts to user identity
- Safety mechanisms for preventing identity destabilization
- Memory-aligned personalization systems
