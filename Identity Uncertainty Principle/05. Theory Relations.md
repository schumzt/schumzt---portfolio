# Connections to Existing Theories

The Identity Uncertainty Principle unifies components of:

---

## 1. Social Psychology

### Persona Theory  
Humans express context-dependent versions of self.  
→ Reframed as superposition collapse.

### Self-Discrepancy Theory  
Dissonance from gaps between actual/ideal/ought selves.  
→ Explained as incompatible persona predictions.

---

## 2. Cognitive Science

### Predictive Processing  
Brain reduces uncertainty via prediction error.  
→ ΔT and ΔA quantify this tension.

### Dual-Process Theory  
System 1 vs System 2 conflict.  
→ Two persona-states with incompatible predictions.

---

## 3. Neuroscience

### Neural ensembles  
Self-states correspond to distinct activation patterns.  
→ Superposition metaphor aligns with overlapping assemblies.

### Plasticity  
Persona probability coefficients evolve over time.

---

## 4. Philosophy

### Narrative Identity Theory  
Identity as evolving story.  
→ Collapse selects narrative-compatible states.

### Existentialism  
Self is not given but continuously chosen.

## 5. Quantum-Inspired Cognitive Models

The theory does not claim quantum behavior.  
It uses quantum *structure* to unify:

- contextuality  
- uncertainty  
- state collapse  
- probability distributions  
- superposition-like internal coexistence
