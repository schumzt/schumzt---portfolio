# 2. Attenuation Curve Theory

## 2.1 Overview
Attenuation Curve Theory explains how memory strength decreases predictably over time due to mechanical, cognitive, and contextual factors.  
The theory proposes a continuous decay function that governs how raw perceptual traces transform into stabilized episodic or semantic representations.

Memory attenuation is not purely exponential; it is shaped by:
- **perceptual interference**
- **contextual noise**
- **semantic load**
- **identity-relevance weighting**
- **retrieval frequency & recency**

The theory models memory decay as a function of both **time** and **structural depth** within the memory stack.



## 2.2 Core Equation
Let:

- **S(t)** = memory strength at time *t*  
- **S₀** = initial strength (sensory-level fidelity)  
- **λᵢ** = attenuation coefficient for memory layer *i*  
- **C(t)** = contextual noise function  
- **R(t)** = reinforcement from retrieval  
- **Iᵣ** = identity-relevance weight (0–1)

The proposed attenuation model:

S(t) = S₀ · e^(−λᵢ·t) + R(t) · Iᵣ  − C(t)

Interpretation:
- High identity relevance slows decay.  
- Retrieval events partially reverse attenuation.  
- Contextual noise lowers signal even without time passing.  
- Deeper layers (semantic, identity) have smaller λ values → slower decay.



## 2.3 Layer-Specific Attenuation Profiles
Different memory layers exhibit distinct attenuation curves.

### **1. Sensory Traces (ST)**
- Nearly immediate decay  
- λ_ST: highest  
- Dominated by perceptual interference  
- Retention window: **300–1000 ms**

Curve shape:

Steep exponential decay with no plateau.



### **2. Episodic Memory Units (EMU)**
- Moderate stability  
- λ_EMU: medium  
- Retrieval sensitive  
- Influenced by emotional salience

Curve shape:

Two-phase decay: rapid drop → shallow tail.

---

### **3. Semantic Clusters (SC)**
- High stability  
- λ_SC: low  
- Strongly influenced by prior knowledge  
- Robust to contextual noise

Curve shape:

Near-linear slow decline approaching asymptote.



### **4. Identity Schema Layer (ISL)**
- Extremely stable  
- λ_ISL: minimal  
- Reinforced by repeated self-referential use  
- Resistant to interference

Curve shape:

Plateau-like function; memory approaches permanent encoding.



## 2.4 Noise & Reinforcement Dynamics

### **Contextual Noise C(t)**
Noise increases when:
- multitasking  
- emotional arousal  
- environmental overload  
- conflicting memory cues

Approximation:

C(t) = α·N_env + β·N_internal

Where:
- α = environmental sensitivity coefficient  
- β = cognitive-emotional sensitivity coefficient



### **Retrieval Reinforcement R(t)**
Retrieval boosts memory strength through reactivation.

Two types:
1. **Active retrieval** — intentional recall  
2. **Passive reactivation** — spontaneous resurfacing, contextual reminders

Approximation:

R(t) = Σ (ΔS_recall_event)

Each retrieval raises S(t) and reduces future attenuation.



## 2.5 Identity-Relevance Weight (Iᵣ)
A central innovation of the theory:  
**Memory decays more slowly when information is tied to personal identity.**

Iᵣ depends on:
- emotional significance  
- personal relevance  
- involvement in long-term goals  
- self-schema consistency  

Approximation:

Iᵣ = w₁·emotional relevance + w₂·goal relevance + w₃·self-schema match

Range: **0–1**

High Iᵣ → memory functions like ISL-level stability.



## 2.6 Summary
Attenuation Curve Theory describes memory decay as a structured, mathematically predictable process sensitive to identity, context, and retrieval frequency.  
The model links low-level perceptual signals to high-level identity stability through layer-specific attenuation coefficients and reinforcement dynamics.

This theory provides the foundation for modeling:
- forgetting curves  
- long-term retention  
- memory robustness  
- identity-weighted encoding  
- human-level cognitive stability
