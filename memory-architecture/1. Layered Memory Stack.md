# 1. Layered Memory Stack

## 1.1 Overview
Human memory can be conceptualized as a multi-layered architecture consisting of short-lived sensory traces, stable episodic records, condensed semantic abstractions, and identity-level schemas. Each layer transforms raw experience into increasingly structured representations. This stratified layout provides robustness, redundancy, and interpretability, enabling cognitive continuity across time.

The key insight of this model is that structural transitions follow strict transformation rules between each memory layer, showing how subjective experience becomes integrated into a unified and stable self-referential system.

## 1.2 Sensory Traces (ST)
Sensory traces represent the most immediate, short-lived layer of memory. They include raw, unprocessed data from visual, auditory, and tactile channels, persisting briefly for 300–1000 ms. Their role is not to store but to act as a temporary buffer that supports rapid updating of perception and provides material for higher layers to encode.

**Core attributes:**
- Duration: **0.3–1.0 seconds**
- High-fidelity, low-abstraction
- Rapid decay unless attended
- No compositional structure  
- Direct mapping to perceptual input

**Mathematical form:**
\[
ST(t) = P(t) + \epsilon
\]
Where \( P(t) \) is real-time perceptual input and \( \epsilon \) is micro-level sensory noise.

## 1.3 Episodic Memory Units (EMU)
Episodic Memory Units consolidate multi-modal sensory traces into structured, time-indexed events. This layer supports autobiographical continuity.

**Characteristics:**
- Duration: **minutes to years**
- Contains spatial–temporal bindings  
- Stores emotional weight  
- High-dimensional but not abstracted  
- Vulnerable to reconstruction errors

**Transformation rule from ST → EMU:**
\[
EMU_i = f(\text{attended } ST) \oplus C_i
\]
Where \( C_i \) is contextual metadata (location, actor, intention).

---

## 1.4 Semantic Clusters (SC)
Semantic Clusters represent long-term conceptual knowledge compressed from repeated episodic patterns. They arise when multiple episodic memories share structural similarity.

**Core features:**
- Abstraction, generalization  
- Stable across contexts  
- Low emotional charge  
- Supports reasoning & prediction

**Compression rule EMU → SC:**
\[
SC = \operatorname{Cluster}\left( \{EMU_1, EMU_2, \dots, EMU_n\} \right)
\]

---

## 1.5 Identity Schema Layer (ISL)
Identity Schemas are the highest layer, encoding self-referential structures such as preferences, values, roles, and long-term goals.

**Properties:**
- Strongest stability over time  
- Guides decision-making  
- Integrates all lower layers  
- Stores belief structures and personal narratives

**Integration rule SC → ISL:**
\[
ISL = \sum_{k=1}^{n} w_k \cdot SC_k
\]
Where weights \( w_k \) reflect relevance, emotional salience, and cognitive priority.

---

## 1.6 Summary
The Layered Memory Stack describes how raw perception evolves into structured identity through sequential transformation layers. Sensory traces form the foundation; episodic events bind experience; semantic clusters generalize across events; and identity schemas unify the system into a stable self-model. This architecture explains coherence, learning, reconstruction, and continuity of personal identity across time.
