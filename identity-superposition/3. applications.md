# Applications of Identity Superposition to AI Safety

## 1. Alignment Modeling
Humans do not express a single stable value function.  
Superposition explains unpredictable preference shifts.

## 2. Predictive Safety Tools
- identity trajectory prediction  
- moral collapse detection  
- value-vector conflict maps  

## 3. Long-Term Identity Stability
AI systems can track memory-value correlations to estimate future identity
states.

## 4. Human-Centered AGI Design
Designs that respect human value multiplicity prevent coercion, collapse,
and identity erosion.
