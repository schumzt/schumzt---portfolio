# AI Safety Protocols — Practical Layer

## 1. Dialogical Safety Protocols (DSP)
A conversational safety model designed to:
- detect harmful context drift
- stabilize value alignment in multi-turn conversations
- prevent bad-faith adversarial prompt exploits

---

## 2. Inference-Time Safety Checks
### A. Attenuation Threshold Check
Detects when long-horizon reasoning diverges from user intention.

### B. Coherence Continuity Check
Ensures narrative consistency → reducing deceptive jumps.

### C. Harmful Optimization Detection
Flags output paths that optimize for latent harmful solutions.

---

## 3. Interpretability-Driven Safety
Model reconstructs its internal reasoning into human-interpretable vectors, not raw chains.

Based on:
- Identity Vector Integration (IVI)
- Contextual Field Dynamics

---

## 4. Self-Regulation Engine Model (SREM)
A conceptual engine for:
- regulating intention alignment  
- suppressing harmful optimization  
- maintaining stable inference attractors

---

## 5. Summary
These protocols integrate my theoretical models into actionable safety steps  
useful for frontier labs evaluating inference-time alignment.
