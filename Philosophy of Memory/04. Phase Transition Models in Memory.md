# Phase Transition Models in Memory Organization

Memory reorganization is nonlinear.

---

## 1. Local Input, Global Reconfiguration
Small changes in context can yield large structural shifts.

Examples:
- A single phrase triggers a cascade of memory activation  
- A minor emotional cue reorganizes meaning clusters  

This resembles phase transitions in physics.

## 2. Conditions for Phase Shifts
Phase transitions occur when:
- Conflict exceeds stability thresholds  
- New context invalidates old organization  
- AI introduces strong external coherence signals  

---

## 3. Computational Formalization
Let memory be a graph G.
Phase transition occurs when:

ΔC (context shift) + ΔI (identity shift) > Stability(G)

Where Stability(G) is a metastability property.

## 4. Implications
- Explains sudden insight  
- Explains identity reboots  
- In AI systems, explains rapid model state shifts
