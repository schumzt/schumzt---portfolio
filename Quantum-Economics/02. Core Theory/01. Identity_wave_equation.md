# Identity Wave Equation  
## Defining the Mathematical Structure of Human Psychological Dynamics

The Identity Wave Equation describes how a person's internal psychological state  
evolves over time as a smooth, continuous wave.

We denote identity as a wave function:

\[
\Psi(t) = \text{Identity Wave at time } t
\]

### Interpretation
- The shape of the wave encodes *potential behavioral states*  
- The amplitude reflects the *strength or readiness of each state*  
- The evolution over time models how internal identity changes

### Proposed Form
We propose a simplified, conceptual equation analogous to quantum evolution:

\[
\frac{d\Psi(t)}{dt} = F(\Psi(t), E(t), C(t))
\]

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| \( \Psi(t) \) | internal identity wave |
| \( E(t) \) | emotional state at time t |
| \( C(t) \) | context/environmental conditions |
| \( F \) | transformation function shaping evolution |

### Why This Matters
- Identity can no longer be modeled as a constant parameter  
- It becomes a *dynamic, evolving function*  
- Behavioral prediction becomes a wave prediction problem  
- Economics must incorporate internal evolution, not just external stimulus

### Conceptual Implication
This wave equation acts as the **generator of behavior**,  
and classical decision-making is simply the *collapsed output*  
of this deeper wave structure.
