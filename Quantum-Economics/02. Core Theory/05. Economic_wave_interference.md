# Economic Wave Interference  
## How Collective Identity Waves Form Markets

Just as physical waves overlap and interfere, creating patterns,  
identity waves also interact within a population.

### Types of Interference

1. **Constructive Interference**  
   When emotional/psychological waves align, amplifying each other.  
   → leads to bubbles, mass optimism, collective spending booms

2. **Destructive Interference**  
   When opposing psychological waves cancel each other.  
   → leads to stagnation, uncertainty, market freezes

3. **Phase-Shift Interference**  
   When different groups operate at different psychological phases.  
   → leads to volatility, economic turbulence, policy unpredictability

### The Market as a Wave Field
Instead of viewing markets as mechanical systems,  
Quantum Economics treats them as **fields of overlapping identity waves**.

Economic events become emergent phenomena produced by:
- collective emotion  
- synchronized expectations  
- oscillations of consumer confidence  
- interference between risk profiles  

### Insight
Markets are not rational machines.  
They are **wave interference patterns** generated  
by billions of interacting identity waves.
