# Why Classical Economics Fails to Explain Real Human Behavior

Mainstream models assume:
- stable preferences  
- consistent risk profiles  
- rational expectations  
- linear reactions to incentives  

But humans violate these assumptions continuously.

### 1. **Preferences Are Not Stable**
A person may value:
- saving in the morning,  
- spending at night,  
- risk-taking on weekends,  
- caution after a crisis.

This looks inconsistent only if we assume identity is constant.  
In the wave model, this is **expected behavior**.

### 2. **Utility Does Not Accurately Represent Internal State**
Utility theory collapses identity into a *single scalar value*.  
But humans occupy **multiple internal states simultaneously**,  
often with competing priorities.

### 3. **Rationality Is State-Dependent**
Humans make different decisions under:
- stress,  
- fear,  
- excitement,  
- fatigue,  
- social pressure.

These states shift the Identity Wave,  
changing decisions without changing underlying preferences.

### 4. **Business Cycles Reflect Psychological Waves**
Markets swing between:
- optimism ↔ pessimism  
- greed ↔ caution  
- expansion ↔ contraction  

This resembles **wave dynamics**, not-linear shocks.

### 5. **Behavioral Economics Fixes Symptoms, Not the Structure**
Behavioral economics lists hundreds of biases,  
but they all originate from the same root:

> The assumption of a stable identity is false.

Quantum Economics replaces the broken foundation  
with a structure that fits real human psychology.
