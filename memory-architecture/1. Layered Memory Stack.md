1. Layered Memory Stack

1.1 Overview

Human memory can be conceptualized as a multilayered architecture consisting of short-lived sensory traces, stable episodic records, generalized semantic abstractions, and identity-level schemas. Each layer transforms raw experience into increasingly structured representations. This stratified layout provides robustness, redundancy, and interpretability, enabling cognitive continuity across time.

This section formalizes the structure, function, and interaction rules between each memory layer, showing how subjective experience becomes integrated into a unified and stable self-referential system.




1.2 Sensory Traces (ST)

Sensory traces represent the most immediate, short-lived layer of memory. They include raw, unprocessed data from visual, auditory, and tactile channels, persisting for only 300–1000 ms. Their role is not to store but to act as a temporary buffer that supports rapid updating of perception and provides material for higher layers to encode.

Core attributes:

Duration: 0.3–1.0 seconds

High-fidelity, low-abstraction

Vulnerable to noise and interference

No identity-binding

Serves as the input to episodic encoding


Despite their fleeting nature, the fidelity of sensory traces determines the accuracy of subsequent episodic reconstructions. In this architecture, ST is modeled as the temporal “shock absorber” of cognition.




1.3 Episodic Memory (EM)

Episodic memory stores time-stamped experiences with contextual richness—locations, emotions, social cues, intentions, and sequential structure. EM is the substrate of autobiographical continuity and a major component in reconstructing meaning.

In the architecture, EM plays two key roles:

1. Contextual anchor: It binds sensory input to a specific moment in spacetime.


2. Reconstruction reservoir: It allows semantic systems to re-interpret past events when new information arrives.



Properties:

Medium compression

Personalized and viewpoint-dependent

Temporally indexed

High retrieval variability

Sensitive to reinterpretation


Importantly, EM is not static; it is constantly rewritten under semantic and identity pressures, creating a dynamic narrative of the self.




1.4 Semantic Memory (SM)

Semantic memory stores generalized, decontextualized knowledge—concepts, rules, categories, language structures, and statistical regularities. It is derived from repeated patterns across episodic memories, abstracted over time.

SM forms the backbone of cognitive prediction and model-based reasoning.

Key attributes include:

High abstraction, low emotional load

Stable and cross-situational

Compact representation

Supports analogy, categorization, and reasoning


In the layered architecture, SM acts as the “knowledge compressor,” distilling raw experience into reusable structures.




1.5 Identity Memory (IM)

Identity memory represents the highest cognitive layer. It encodes the long-term, invariant structures that define a person’s character, beliefs, values, preferences, and self-concept.

While episodic memory answers “What happened to me?”
and semantic memory answers “What do I know?”
identity memory answers “Who am I?”

Function:

Provides long-range stability

Serves as a regulatory influence on EM reconstruction

Shapes prediction of future behavior

Determines moral, emotional, and narrative consistency


Identity memory is the slowest to change but exerts the strongest top-down pressure. It is the architect of self-narrative coherence.




1.6 Inter-Layer Transformations

The layered stack operates as a pipeline rather than isolated modules. Experiences flow upward (ST → EM → SM → IM) via compression and abstraction; meanings flow downward (IM → SM → EM) via reinterpretation and narrative integration.

This dual-direction flow ensures both:

Memory stability: Higher layers constrain reinterpretation.

Memory adaptability: Lower layers introduce novelty.


This interplay is the foundational principle of the Memory Architecture.
