# Epistemic Foundations  
How Knowledge Forms, Stabilizes, and Evolves

## 1. Knowledge as Compression
All human knowledge is compressed history.  
We do not store exact details — we store *structures*, *patterns*, and *regularities*.

Knowledge emerges when compression retains meaning.

## 2. The Reliability Cycle
Knowledge stabilizes through:
1. repeated observation  
2. internal generalization  
3. cross-context validation  

This cycle produces epistemic resilience.

## 3. Error as Information
Errors refine the compression algorithm.  
Every contradiction reveals the boundary of a concept and sharpens its definition.

## 4. Implications for AI
AI systems should mirror this epistemic structure:
- context-sensitive compression  
- iterative updating  
- error-driven refinement  

A good epistemic foundation prevents:
- hallucinations  
- brittle reasoning  
- overfitting to context  

Knowledge is not static — it is a living structure.
