# Research Agenda — Future Directions

## 1. Identity Superposition as Alignment Foundation
Investigate whether identity-vector collapse events  
correlate with alignment failures in large models.

---

## 2. Attenuation-Based Ethical Reasoning
Develop attenuation-aware ethics modules for:
- long-horizon planning
- multi-agent systems
- human-AI cooperation

---

## 3. Narrative Coherence as a Safety Signal
Measure whether *coherence disruption* predicts:
- deceptive behavior
- optimization drift
- manipulation attempts

---

## 4. Sky Governance Models
Exploring global-scale governance for:
- autonomous drone/air-traffic AI systems  
- surveillance minimization  
- distributed ethical coordination

---

## 5. Human–AI Co-Evolution Protocols
Design long-horizon frameworks for:
- augmentation without dependency  
- co-development of ethical norms  
- stable cooperation across generations

---

## 6. Applied Outputs in Progress
- Computational philosophy papers  
- Memory architecture modeling  
- Formalization of Moral Attenuation Theory  
- Experiments with identity-vector dynamics

This agenda evolves as my theoretical frameworks mature.
