# Core Theory Summary  
## The Foundations of Quantum Economics

This chapter introduced six key ideas:

1. **Identity Wave Equation**  
   Identity evolves as a wave, not a fixed parameter.

2. **Uncertainty Principle**  
   Psychological dimensions limit each other; behavior can never be precisely predicted.

3. **State Collapse**  
   Decisions are collapsed outputs of deep identity waves.

4. **Superposition**  
   Conflicting internal states coexist until forced to collapse.

5. **Wave Interference**  
   Markets emerge from interactions of billions of identity waves.

### Why This Changes Economics
Traditional economics assumes:
- stable preferences  
- rational consistency  
- linear incentive response  

Quantum Economics reveals that:
- preferences fluctuate  
- rationality is state-dependent  
- identity is probabilistic  
- economics is built on waves, not constants

This chapter establishes the mathematical and conceptual backbone  
for building predictive, psychologically grounded economic models.
