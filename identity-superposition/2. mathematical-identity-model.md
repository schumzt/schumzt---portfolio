# Mathematical Identity Model

A formal structure describing identity as a superposition system over value
vectors, including activation functions, divergence metrics, and update
rules.

## 1. Value Vector Space
Identity vectors exist in a high-dimensional preference space  
\[
V_k \in \mathbb{R}^d
\]

## 2. Superposition Equation
\[
I(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k(t) V_k
\]

## 3. Activation Dynamics
Weights update via:
\[
\frac{d\alpha_k}{dt} = g(M(t), C(t), H(t))
\]

## 4. Divergence Metric
Identity drift magnitude:
\[
D = \| I(t+\Delta t) - I(t) \|
\]

## 5. Stability Conditions
Identity is stable when:
- activation variance is low,
- memory decay is slow,
- and contextual noise is limited.

This model provides mathematical grounding for identity superposition theory.
