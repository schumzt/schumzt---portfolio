5. Stability Conditions

Identity Vector Integration (IVI) remains stable only when its internal update dynamics satisfy a set of quantitative and structural constraints. Stability here refers to the preservation of coherent identity representation across time—preventing uncontrolled drift, phase oscillation, or collapse toward a degenerate vector state.

We define IVI stability as the condition under which the expected deviation

D(t) = \left\| I(t) - I(t-1) \right\|

Formally:

5.1 Activation Variance Constraint

The instantaneous activation field

A(t) = f(M(t), C(t), H(t))

\mathrm{Var}(A_{t:t+\Delta t}) < \sigma_{\text{max}}

Where:

 is the maximum tolerable fluctuation

Excessive variance implies unstable emotional or contextual influence


This condition ensures that the IVI system does not react disproportionately to transient noise.

5.2 Slow Memory-Decay Requirement

Long-term weights  must not decay faster than a defined half-life:

\frac{dw_i}{dt} > -\lambda_{\text{crit}}

Where:

 represents the critical decay threshold

Too rapid decay causes identity fragmentation or loss of continuity


This models how coherent personal identity requires retention of value vectors over extended temporal windows.

5.3 Contextual Noise Limitation

External context-driven modulation must remain below a distortion bound:

\| C_{\text{noise}}(t) \| < \epsilon

Large contextual noise introduces instability by shifting the identity vector toward transient, reactive states.
Bounding this ensures that the identity system resists external perturbations.

5.4 Stability Criterion

An IVI system is considered stable if:

D(t) < \delta_{\text{stability}}

Where:

 is the permitted continuity deviation

 captures identity drift magnitude


This criterion formally connects the mathematical dynamics of activation, decay, and contextual noise with the qualitative experience of “being the same person” across time.

5.5 Interpretation

A stable IVI state corresponds to:

consistent internal values

predictable reflective behavior

preserved self-continuity

resistance to emotional or contextual perturbation


This mirrors both cognitive neuroscience findings (self-schema stability) and AI-agent identity modeling principles.
