# Self-Regulation Engine Model (SREM)

## 1. Concept Overview
SREM is a computational-philosophical framework that describes how 
an intelligent agent (biological or artificial) maintains internal stability, 
resolves conflict, and preserves long-term coherence across dynamic environments.

It treats “self-regulation” as a multi-layer engine rather than a singular mechanism,
integrating emotion, cognition, memory, predictive modeling, and ethical constraints.

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1 Regulatory Stack
- **Layer 1: Physiological Regulation**
  - Drives, impulses, basic needs
  - Baseline arousal modulation
  - Safety-threat assessment

- **Layer 2: Emotional Regulation**
  - Affect labeling
  - Emotional reframing
  - Stress-signal compression

- **Layer 3: Cognitive Regulation**
  - Self-monitoring
  - Error signal detection
  - Meta-cognitive realignment

- **Layer 4: Behavioral Regulation**
  - Action gating
  - Habit override mechanisms
  - Policy switching

- **Layer 5: Moral-Normative Regulation**
  - Value alignment
  - Ethical prioritization
  - Social-contextual constraints

### 2.2 Engine Components
- **Internal State Monitor (ISM)**
- **Conflict Resolution Core (CRC)**
- **Predictive Stabilizer Module (PSM)**
- **Long-Horizon Consistency Manager (LHCM)**
- **Ethical Constraint Overlay (ECO)**

## 3. Regulation Cycle (SRC Loop)

### Phase 1 — State Reading
- Decode current emotional, cognitive, and situational inputs
- Compare with internal baseline & desired trajectory

### Phase 2 — Conflict Mapping
- Identify deviations, contradictions, overload signals
- Categorize: emotional, cognitive, behavioral, ethical

### Phase 3 — Intervention Selection
- Select optimal regulatory strategy:
  - Down-regulation
  - Up-regulation
  - Reframing
  - Action inhibition
  - Long-horizon override

### Phase 4 — Execution & Adaptation
- Apply regulatory action
- Update internal models
- Minimize instability

### 4.1 Cognitive Strategies
- Reappraisal
- Attention redirection
- Abstraction elevation (“zoom-out mode”)
- Counterfactual filtering

### 4.2 Emotional Strategies
- Naming emotions explicitly
- Normalizing physiological arousal
- Temporal distancing

### 4.3 Behavioral Strategies
- Delay-action protocol
- Micro-task segmentation
- Habit disruption events

### 4.4 Moral-Normative Strategies
- Apply ethical priority ordering
- Avoid short-term gains that violate long-term stability
- Constraint-preserving decision gates

## 5. Predictive Stability Engine

### 5.1 Forecasting Stability Peaks
- Expected emotional load
- Cognitive complexity forecasts
- Environmental volatility predictions

### 5.2 Stability Protection Mechanisms
- Pre-emptive buffering
- Priority inversion handling
- Memory load rebalancing

## 6. Diagnostic Modes

### 6.1 Self-Interrogation Protocol
- “What signal is dominating?”
- “What is the prediction error?”
- “What would stabilize the system?”

### 6.2 Regulation Failure Patterns
- Over-regulation (rigidity)
- Under-regulation (chaos)
- Cross-layer conflicts (emotion vs. ethics)

### 6.3 Repair Mechanisms
- Re-anchoring baseline
- Resetting cognitive load
- Realigning moral constraints
