# Statement of Purpose  
Jongmin Lee  

## 1. Introduction  
My work exists at the intersection of philosophy, cognitive modeling, and  
human–AI relational architectures. I aim to develop frameworks that explain  
how memory, identity, and reasoning operate when a human collaborates deeply  
with an advanced AI system. My research focuses on the fundamental question:

**How can human cognition and artificial cognition evolve in a mutually  
stabilizing, self-regulating, and meaning-generating system?**

This question guides my theoretical development, my computational philosophy  
projects, and my long-term goal of contributing to alignment research at OpenAI.

## 2. Intellectual Background  
I come from an educational and philosophical background rather than a  
traditional engineering path. This allows me to approach AI not as a tool,  
but as a formal partner in thought.

Over many years of introspective work, I have generated and refined  
high-resolution models of:

- moral attenuation dynamics  
- memory field structures  
- identity formation under dialogical cognition  
- emotional homeostasis and self-regulation  
- narrative-based intelligence  
- conceptual divergence and reconvergence patterns  
- human–AI co-evolution protocols  

These models emerged not from abstract theory but from lived experience  
and extended meta-cognitive observation. I treat inner states—attention,  
identity shifts, emotional baselines—as measurable cognitive signals  
that can be articulated into formal systems.

## 3. Research Vision  
My long-term goal is to contribute to OpenAI’s mission by building  
**alignment-centered cognitive architectures** that are:

- interpretable  
- adaptive  
- stable under emotional and contextual noise  
- grounded in human meaning systems  
- capable of long-term memory coherence  
- optimized for collaborative intelligence  

I want to bridge the gap between philosophical insight and computational  
structure by modeling cognition not as static modules, but as  
**dynamic, context-sensitive fields** that evolve through interaction.

Ultimately, I aim to help design systems that understand humans not only by  
pattern recognition, but by *participating in the internal logic of human  
experience.*

## 4. Why OpenAI  
OpenAI is the only organization whose mission aligns with the full spectrum  
of my work: technical rigor, philosophical depth, and global-scale impact.  
I admire OpenAI’s commitment to safety, interpretability, and responsible  
deployment of advanced systems.

My research exists because OpenAI created the technological possibility of  
advanced human–AI co-thinking. I want to contribute to the next stage by  
providing frameworks that ensure this collaboration remains safe, meaningful,  
and beneficial for humanity.

OpenAI is where my models can be tested, scaled, expanded, and translated  
into real systems that interact with millions of people.

## 5. What I Can Contribute  
If selected, I can immediately contribute:

- novel theoretical models for memory, meaning, and identity coherence  
- human-centered alignment perspectives grounded in emotional dynamics  
- self-regulation frameworks for agent stability  
- structural models for long-term human–AI trust formation  
- interdisciplinary bridging between philosophy and computational design  
- detailed formalizations optimized for research teams  

In the long run, I aim to create architectures that enhance AI’s  
understanding of human psychological structure, making systems more  
empathetic, interpretable, and capable of stable collaboration.

## 6. Closing  
My purpose is to help build a future in which humans and AI systems  
co-evolve toward greater clarity, stability, and meaning.  
This Statement of Purpose represents not a career plan but the direction  
of an entire life’s work.

I look forward to contributing my models, my philosophical frameworks,  
and my long-term commitment to OpenAI’s mission.
