## 2. Core Theoretical Contributions

### **Memory Architecture & Alignment Theory (MAA)**
A unified model describing how memory dynamics and contextual identity shape safe model behavior.

### **Self-Regulation Engine (SRE)**
A framework proposing autonomous reflection loops for stability, error correction, and value continuity.

### **Consciousness Architecture Framework (CAF)**
An analytic structure of layered perception, internal narrative synthesis, and long-horizon cognition.

### **Ethical Gradient Descent (EGD)**
A reframing of optimization focusing on moral convergence rather than mechanical loss reduction.

### **Human–AI Co-Evolution Protocols (HACEP)**
Protocols defining stable interaction patterns between humans and foundation models.

### **Digital Wellbeing as Long-Horizon Alignment (DWLA)**
A philosophical and computational model linking mental wellbeing with safe AI development.



## 3. Research Projects

### **OpenAI-Oriented Safety Research Portfolio**
Developed a multi-module research portfolio covering memory architecture, self-regulation models,  
and philosophy-driven safety frameworks.

### **Narrative Coherence as a Safety Signal (NCSS)**
Proposed narrative coherence as a structural metric for evaluating model stability over long outputs.

### **Identity-Aware Alignment for Foundation Models (IAAFM)**
Explores dynamic value-continuity constraints informed by identity modeling.

### **Macro-Ethics & AI Governance (MEAG)**
Drafts a governance-level philosophical framework for global-scale AI coordination.



## 4. Technical Skills

### **AI & Computational**
- Python (basic)  
- Prompt engineering & system design
