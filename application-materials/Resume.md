## RESEARCH PROJECTS
### **Memory Architecture & Alignment Theory (MAA)**
Proposes a unified system describing memory-state transitions, contextual fields, and value-stable cognition.

### **Self-Regulation Engine (SRE)**
Model for reflective loops enabling error correction, stability tracking, and autonomous self-governance.

### **Consciousness Architecture Framework (CAF)**
Layered structure modeling perception, internal narratives, and identity-based reasoning.

### **Narrative Coherence Safety Metrics**
Defines coherence, divergence, and identity-continuity as alignment signals for long-sequence models.
