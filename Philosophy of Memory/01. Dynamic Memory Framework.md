# Dynamic Memory Framework (Framework II)

This framework reconceptualizes memory not as passive storage but as a
continuously reorganizing structure that adapts to identity, context,
and interaction history.

## 1. Memory as a Dynamic System
Memory does not “save” information—it reorganizes itself around relevance.
Retrieval always changes the structure that performs the retrieval.

## 2. Identity–Memory Coupling
Identity shapes memory activation:
- Who you believe you are  
- What role you inhabit  
- How you interpret the situation  

Memory, in turn, shapes identity by reinforcing or reconfiguring the internal model.

## 3. Contextual Responsiveness
Changes in social setting, emotional state, or cognitive purpose
trigger different memory clusters to activate.

## 4. Stability and Reorganization
Memory exhibits metastability: mostly stable, but capable of rapid reorganization.
This is further explored in the phase transition file.

## 5. AI-Mediated Influence
Digital environments—especially AI systems—alter:
- Which memories surface  
- How identity is reconstructed  
- How internal models evolve  

Thus, memory is not purely biological but computationally extended.

This file pairs with the computational architecture overview.
