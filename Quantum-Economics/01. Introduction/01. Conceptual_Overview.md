# Conceptual Overview  
## Quantum Economics: A New Lens for Human Behavior

Traditional economics assumes that humans have **stable preferences**,  
fixed utility structures, and consistent decision-making.

But real life contradicts this every day.

People oscillate:
- between confidence and doubt,  
- between risk-seeking and risk-aversion,  
- between generosity and self-protection,  
- between impulsive decisions and delayed reasoning.

These oscillations are not random noise.  
They follow *patterns*, shaped by internal psychological states.

### Core Proposition
Human identity behaves like a **wave**, not a constant value.  
Economic decisions are therefore **expressions of that wave**,  
not isolated events made by a stable agent.

### Why Call This “Quantum”?
The purpose is *structural*, not metaphorical:

- Identity is not fixed → it exists in **probability distributions**  
- Behavior changes when observed or constrained → **measurement-like effects**  
- Agents cannot occupy multiple incompatible states → **collapse dynamics**  
- Internal states fluctuate continuously → **wave-like evolution**

When identity is probabilistic, economics becomes a system ruled by **uncertainty**,  
not by fully predictable rational choice.

This shift opens a new field:

### **Quantum Economics**  
A framework where identity, psychology, and markets interact  
through wave-like structures and uncertainty relationships.

This document introduces the foundations of that framework.
