# 6. Divergence Conditions (DC)

## 6.1 Overview
Divergence Conditions (DC) describe the set of cognitive, structural, and dynamic factors that destabilize the Identity Vector Integration (IVI) process.  
Whereas Stability Conditions define when identity remains coherent, DC specifies when identity begins to drift, split, fragment, or distort.

Divergence becomes likely when:
- updating signals exceed system tolerance  
- semantic clusters compete without resolution  
- emotional valences saturate or conflict  
- autobiographical traces contradict emerging identity vectors  
- long-term goals destabilize due to contextual shocks

## 6.2 Sources of Divergence

### **1. Excessive Variance in Episodic Input (EVEI)**
Occurs when recent episodic events introduce conflicting directional vectors.

Characteristics:
- contradictory emotional valences  
- inconsistent role schemas  
- rapid context switching  
- high novelty density  

Formal representation:
\[
D_{\text{episodic}} = \sigma(E_t) - \sigma_{\text{threshold}}
\]

If \( D_{\text{episodic}} > 0 \), divergence pressure increases.

---

### **2. Semantic Cluster Competition (SCC)**
Divergence arises when two or more semantic clusters push incompatible forecasts for future identity states.

Indicators:
- mutually exclusive value frameworks  
- contradictory predictions  
- unresolved cognitive dissonance  

Formalization:
\[
C_{\text{SCC}} = \sum |SC_i - SC_j|
\]

High \( C_{\text{SCC}} \) = identity bifurcation risk.

---

### **3. Goal Vector Misalignment (GVM)**
Long-term goals drift from existing identity vectors.

Causes:
- chronic motivational conflict  
- environmental collapse of prior goals  
- sudden inversion of expected reward landscapes  

Mathematical condition:
\[
D_{\text{goal}} = ||G_{t} - IVI_{t}||
\]

If the difference exceeds a system-defined tolerance, identity destabilizes.

---

### **4. Emotional Valence Saturation (EVS)**
A state where emotional activation exceeds regulatory bandwidth.

Symptoms:
- overamplified fear/attachment signals  
- emotional flooding  
- inability to integrate new episodic data  

Threshold model:
\[
EVS = \frac{\sum |v_e|}{B_{\text{reg}}}
\]

If \( EVS > 1 \), integration fails to normalize.

---

### **5. Contextual Role Fragmentation (CRF)**
Identity begins to diverge when incompatible social roles cannot be integrated.

Examples:
- conflicting moral role vs. practical role  
- dual self-images that lack a unifying schema  
- frequent context switching with no meta-schema  

Formal:
\[
CRF = \sum |R_i - R_j|
\]

---

## 6.3 Divergence Dynamics

### **A. Runaway Feedback Loop**
Occurs when divergence in one domain amplifies another.

Process:
- episodic contradiction → semantic instability  
- semantic instability → emotional saturation  
- emotional saturation → higher episodic contradiction  

Recursive form:
\[
D_{t+1} = f(D_t) + \epsilon
\]

---

### **B. Identity Vector Splitting**
If divergence forces exceed structural tolerance, IVI produces parallel identity projections.

Manifestations:
- inconsistent goals across contexts  
- fluctuating self-definitions  
- unstable behavioral predictions  

---

### **C. Collapse into Null Identity (rare)**
Occurs only in extreme overload or trauma-like conditions.

System collapses to:
\[
IVI_{t+1} \approx 0
\]

This represents identity blackout, dissociation, or system-level shutdown.

---

## 6.4 Mitigation Paths

### **1. Semantic Realignment**
- recompute cluster proximities  
- create new bridging schemas  
- reduce contradiction through reinterpretation  

### **2. Emotional Down-Regulation**
- lower valence saturation  
- normalize episodic encoding bandwidth  

### **3. Goal Re-Specification**
- redefine long-term goals  
- align reward vectors with current identity gradients  

### **4. Contextual Integration**
- unify conflicting role schemas  
- generate higher-order identity narratives

## 6.5 Summary
Divergence Conditions outline when identity begins to drift, fragment, or destabilize due to conflicting episodic inputs, competing semantic clusters, misaligned goals, or emotional overload.  
Understanding DC is essential for predicting when identity coherence breaks down—and how to re-stabilize the system through semantic alignment, emotional regulation, and goal restructuring.
