## 5. Stability Conditions

Identity Vector Integration (IVI) maintains stability only when its internal update processes follow a set of quantitative and structural constraints. Stability refers to the system’s ability to preserve coherent, continuous identity vectors across time while resisting drift, collapse, or oscillatory divergence.

Stability is defined as maintaining the identity deviation:

\[
D(t) = \| I(t) - I(t-1) \|
\]

within a bounded threshold:

\[
D(t) < \delta_{\text{max}}
\]

### 5.1 Activation Variance Constraint (AVC)

Identity becomes unstable when activation variance exceeds a manageable limit.

Let:

\[
A(t) = \text{activation level at time } t
\]

Variance is computed as:

\[
\text{Var}(A) = \mathbb{E}\big[(A(t) - \mu_A)^2\big]
\]

#### 1. Stability Requirement  
- Variance must remain below the upper bound:
\[
\text{Var}(A) < \sigma_{\text{max}}^2
\]

#### 2. Interpretation  
- Excessive variance implies emotional or contextual over-amplification.  
- Prevents runaway reactions triggered by transient noise.

### 5.2 Slow-Memory Decay Requirement

Long-term memory weights must decay gradually to preserve identity continuity.

Let:

\[
M(t) = \text{long-term memory strength}
\]

Decay constraint:

\[
\frac{dM}{dt} > -\lambda_{\text{min}}
\]

#### 1. Interpretation  
- If memory decays too quickly, identity continuity collapses.  
- Prevents fragmentation or context-dependent identity resets.

---

### 5.3 Boundary Saturation Limit

Identity vectors must operate within representational bounds.

For an identity vector \( I \in \mathbb{R}^n \):

\[
\| I(t) \| < B_{\text{max}}
\]

#### 1. Interpretation  
- Exceeding this threshold implies cognitive overload or extreme emotional states.  
- Prevents transitions into pathological attractors.

---

### 5.4 Noise-Resilience Condition

Let external disturbance be represented by noise \( \eta(t) \).

Stability requires:

\[
\| \eta(t) \| < \epsilon_{\text{max}}
\]

#### 1. Interpretation  
- Prevents hypersensitivity to minor environmental fluctuations.  
- Ensures robustness across unpredictable contexts.

---

### 5.5 Minimum Coherence Alignment

IVI stability requires coherence between identity sub-vectors.

Let \( I_k(t) \) and \( I_j(t) \) be sub-components.

\[
\text{sim}(I_k(t), I_j(t)) > \theta_{\text{min}}
\]

#### 1. Interpretation  
- Prevents contradictory self-representations.  
- Maintains global identity consistency across contexts.

---

### 5.6 Global Stability Criterion

The identity system is globally stable only when **all** constraints hold:

\[
\begin{aligned}
D(t) &< \delta_{\text{max}} \\
\text{Var}(A) &< \sigma_{\text{max}}^2 \\
\frac{dM}{dt} &> -\lambda_{\text{min}} \\
\| I(t) \| &< B_{\text{max}} \\
\| \eta(t) \| &< \epsilon_{\text{max}} \\
\text{sim}(I_k, I_j) &> \theta_{\text{min}}
\end{aligned}
\]

---

### 5.7 Summary

Stability in IVI is a regulated equilibrium state in which:

- identity deviation remains controlled  
- noise influence stays within tolerable bounds  
- sub-component similarity is preserved  
- long-term memory maintains continuity  
- representational magnitude remains within safe limits  

Stable IVI enables the identity system to integrate new experiences while maintaining coherence, continuity, and adaptability.
