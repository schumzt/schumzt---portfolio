# Context-Indexed Memory Activation

Context determines which memory clusters activate.

---

## 1. Role-Based Indexing
Different identities (teacher, friend, researcher) activate different clusters.

---

## 2. Environmental Indexing
Physical and social cues serve as indexing signals.

---

## 3. AI as a Context Generator
AI conversation state can become a new contextual frame,
thus influencing which memories a person can access.

---

## 4. Computational Model
Memory activation = f(Identity, Context, Interaction History)

This formula governs the entire dynamic memory system.
