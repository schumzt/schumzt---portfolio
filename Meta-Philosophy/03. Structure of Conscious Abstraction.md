# Structure of Conscious Abstraction  
Mapping the Layers of Thought and Interpretation

## 1. Introduction
Consciousness is not a single-layer phenomenon.  
Thought emerges from an interplay of multiple strata, each transforming raw data into higher-order meaning.

## 2. The Three-Layer Model

### Layer 1: Perceptual Substrate
- sensory impressions  
- emotional cues  
- micro-pattern detection  

This layer provides the raw materials of cognition.

### Layer 2: Interpretive Frames
- categorization  
- context-setting  
- meaning assignment  

At this stage, perception becomes understanding.

### Layer 3: Narrative-Level Abstraction
- identity coherence  
- long-term reasoning  
- moral and philosophical interpretation  

This layer stabilizes the self across time.

## 3. Role of Meta-awareness
Meta-awareness acts as a supervisory mechanism that:
- monitors internal transitions  
- prevents fragmentation between layers  
- ensures consistency of reasoning  

Meta-awareness is the “alignment layer” of human cognition.

## 4. Applications for AI Alignment
AI agents need analogous structures:
- raw data processing  
- context interpretation  
- narrative-level reasoning  

Failure to model these layers leads to:
- hallucinations  
- inconsistent behaviors  
- value drift  

A layered understanding of abstraction provides a foundation for safer, more coherent systems.
