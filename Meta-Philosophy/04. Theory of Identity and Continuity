# Theory of Identity and Continuity  
A Dynamic Model of Self Across Changing Cognitive States

## 1. Identity as a Dynamic State
Identity is not a fixed essence.  
It is a **probabilistic distribution over potential selves**, shaped by memory, emotion, and context.

Different states activate depending on:
- environment  
- cognitive load  
- narrative relevance  

Identity is dynamic but bounded.

## 2. The Principle of Temporal Coherence
Continuity arises when transitions follow stable patterns, such as:
- consistent emotional signatures  
- persistent values  
- predictable narrative interpretation  

Temporal coherence is what makes “I” feel like the same person across years.

## 3. Identity Superposition
A self can hold multiple latent configurations simultaneously, collapsing into one depending on context.

This “superposition model” enables:
- flexibility without fragmentation  
- adaptability without erasing core traits  

## 4. Relevance for AI Agents
AI systems must also maintain:
- stable preferences  
- consistent self-models  
- predictable identity transitions  

Dynamic identity modeling prevents issues like:
- context-induced value shifts  
- unstable moral reasoning  
- behavioral incoherence
