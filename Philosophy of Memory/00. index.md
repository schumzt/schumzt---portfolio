# Philosophy of Memory – A Computational Research Program

This repository introduces a new systems-level framework for understanding
memory and identity as dynamically coupled processes shaped by context,
interaction history, and computational mediation.

The project is organized into the following components:

1. **Dynamic Memory Framework**  
   A new model describing memory as an adaptive, self-reorganizing system.

2. **Computational Architecture for Dynamic Memory and Identity**  
   A structured theory connecting memory processes with AI models,
   feedback dynamics, and computer-mediated reconstruction.

3. **Identity–Memory Interaction Models**  
   How remembering actively reshapes identity in subtle, continuous ways.

4. **Phase Transition Models in Memory Structure**  
   Small contextual cues can trigger large-scale reorganizations of memory.

5. **Context-Indexed Activation**  
   A computational explanation for why memories surface differently depending
   on role, situation, or psychological frame.

6. **Notes & Research Background**  
   Supporting arguments, literature connections, and development plans.

7. **Diagrams & Visual Architecture**  
   High-level illustrations showing structural relationships.

8. **Drafts and Early Versions**  
   Previous versions and conceptual seeds left for transparency.

This framework is part of a broader research effort aimed at integrating
epistemology, phenomenology, and computational modeling to create
an aligned understanding of human–AI memory dynamics.
