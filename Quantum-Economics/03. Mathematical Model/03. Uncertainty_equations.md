# Uncertainty Equations  
## Formalizing Trade-Offs in Human Psychology

We define several uncertainty relations that mirror Heisenberg-style limits.

---

## 1. Thought–Action Uncertainty

\[
\Delta T \cdot \Delta A \ge k_1
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta T \): variability in thought clarity  
- \( \Delta A \): variability in spontaneous behavior  

A highly reflective state suppresses impulsive action, and vice versa.

---

## 2. Stability–Flexibility Uncertainty

\[
\Delta S \cdot \Delta F \ge k_2
\]

No human can be maximally stable and maximally adaptive.

---

## 3. Internal Coherence–External Adaptation

\[
\Delta C_i \cdot \Delta C_e \ge k_3
\]

Where:
- \( C_i \): internal alignment  
- \( C_e \): environmental responsiveness

## Why These Equations Matter
Uncertainty is *not noise*.  
It is a **structural limit** imposed by wave-like identity architecture.

This explains the impossibility of perfect rationality  
and provides a mathematical foundation for behavioral variability.
