# schumzt — portfolio  
_A unified research portfolio in computational philosophy, dynamic memory architecture,  
identity modeling, and long-horizon AI alignment._

This repository is a comprehensive archive of my theoretical, philosophical,  
and computational work at the intersection of:

- Memory as a dynamic computational architecture  
- Identity as a reconstructive and superpositional system  
- AI alignment and long-horizon ethical reasoning  
- Human–AI interaction and co-evolution  
- Systems-level frameworks for interpretable intelligence  

Rather than a software portfolio, this repository represents a **research program** —  
a multi-framework attempt to build conceptual foundations for safer, more coherent,  
and identity-aware AI systems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Below is an overview of the major folders and what each contains.  
(For exact filenames and sections, please refer to each folder directly.)

---

### 📁 `Philosophy-of-Memory/`

A multi-part framework defining memory as a continuously reorganizing system  
that shapes and is shaped by identity and context.

Typical contents:

- Introductory overview of the Philosophy of Memory project  
- Modules on dynamic memory, identity–memory coupling,  
  context-indexed activation, phase transitions, and AI-mediated influence  
- High-resolution diagrams (overview, dynamic-memory, feedback loops, etc.)

This is one of the central pillars of my computational philosophy.

---

### 📁 `identity-superposition/`

My foundational theory treating identity as a superpositional, dynamically collapsible state.

Typical contents:

- Core theoretical write-ups on Primordial Identity Superposition  
- Cross-disciplinary bridges connecting philosophy, computation, and ethics  
- Conceptual diagrams visualizing the structure of identity

---

### 📁 `computational-philosophy/`

Frameworks that reinterpret philosophical constructs  
in computationally expressible and architecturally meaningful forms.

Contains text modules that:

- Develop dialogical or “mirror-like” models of mind  
- Propose meta-frameworks for structuring complex theories  
- Explore how abstract concepts can be encoded as system architectures

---

### 📁 `AI-Safety-notes/`

A collection of long-horizon, identity-aware, and narrative-informed alignment ideas.

Examples include:

- Notes on long-horizon ethics and macro-level AI governance  
- Digital wellbeing and psychological safety considerations  
- Identity-aware alignment strategies and narrative coherence as a safety signal  

These notes form the ethical backbone of the research program.

---

### 📁 `memory-architecture/`

Technical and conceptual drafts for a computational memory architecture  
that reflects the dynamic models described in the Philosophy-of-Memory series.

Includes drafts on:

- Dynamic reorganization of memory  
- Phase-like shifts and large-scale re-clustering  
- Reconstruction loops linking memory and identity  
- Early architectural sketches

---

### 📁 `creative-works/`

Conceptual visuals and symbolic diagrams that express the theories  
in a compact, high-impact visual form.

Useful for:

- presentations  
- talks and interviews  
- visual communication of complex theoretical structures  

---

### 📁 `personal-timeline/`

Documentation of the research progression, major breakthroughs,  
and long-horizon planning.

---

### 📁 `research-drafts/`

Unpublished early drafts, experimental mappings, and exploratory notes  
that lay the groundwork for future papers and frameworks.

## 🧠 Research Themes

Across all folders, the work converges on a few core themes:

1. **Dynamic Memory Theory** – Memory as an adaptive, reorganizing computational structure.  
2. **Identity Modeling** – Identity as a feedback-driven, reconstructive, sometimes superpositional system.  
3. **Human–AI Co-Evolution** – How AI reshapes human identity, and how human structure should guide AI design.  
4. **AI Alignment & Ethics** – Identity-aware, context-sensitive, narrative-coherent approaches to alignment.  
5. **Computational Philosophy** – Translating philosophical problems into architectures usable by future intelligent systems.

## 🎨 Diagrammatic Research

Many folders include high-resolution diagrams in a consistent research aesthetic  
(gold on dark background, structurally clean layouts).  
These are not merely illustrations but integral components of the theories.

---

## 🧭 Vision

The long-term vision of this repository is to become  
a unified, evolving research program that provides  
**new computational foundations for identity, memory, and aligned intelligence.**

Ultimately, this work aims to contribute to the design of safer,  
more interpretable, and deeply human-centered AI systems.
