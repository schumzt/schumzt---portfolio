# Mathematical Model Summary  
## Core Equations Defining Quantum Economics

This chapter formalized the mathematical structure behind the theory.

---

# 1. Identity Wave Evolution

\[
\frac{d\Psi}{dt} = H(t)\Psi
\]

Identity evolves continuously as influenced by emotional and contextual fields.

---

# 2. Uncertainty Principles

\[
\Delta T \cdot \Delta A \ge k_1,\quad
\Delta S \cdot \Delta F \ge k_2
\]

Human behavior has structural limits on predictability.

---

# 3. Collapse Model

\[
P(B_i) = |\langle B_i | \Psi(t) \rangle|^2
\]

Economic actions are collapsed outcomes of identity waves.

---

# 4. Market Wave Field

\[
\Phi(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N \Psi_i(t)
\]

Collective identity interactions generate market cycles.

## Why This Matters
This mathematical backbone transforms economics from:
- linear models → wave dynamics  
- rational choice → probabilistic identity collapse  
- isolated agents → interacting fields  

Quantum Economics becomes a **unified framework**  
linking psychology, decision science, and macroeconomics.
