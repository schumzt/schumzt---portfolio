# What Is the Identity Wave?

Identity is traditionally seen as:
- a personality,
- a preference profile,
- a stable set of traits.

But in reality, identity is **dynamic and context-dependent**.

### Identity as a Wave Function
The **Identity Wave** is a model describing how an individual’s  
internal state evolves over time:

- It fluctuates between possible roles  
- It changes amplitude based on environment  
- It collapses into a “decision state” when action is required  
- It interacts with external incentives and internal emotions  
- It is inherently **probabilistic**, not deterministic

### Features of the Identity Wave
1. **Superposition**  
   Multiple internal states coexist (e.g., “want to save” and “want to spend”).

2. **Collapse**  
   A specific behavior emerges when a decision is forced.

3. **Uncertainty Pair**  
   Some psychological variables constrain each other, such as:  
   - clarity ↔ spontaneity  
   - stability ↔ variability  
   - focus ↔ openness

4. **Wave Evolution**  
   Identity changes smoothly over time rather than jumping randomly.

5. **External Coupling**  
   Economic incentives, social context, and emotional state  
   continuously reshape the wave.

### Why It Matters
If identity is a wave, then **economic behavior is the visible surface**  
of a deeper internal oscillation.

Markets, therefore, are not merely the sum of transactions—  
they are reflections of collective psychological waves.
