# Mathematical Identity Model

A formal structure describing identity as a superposition system over value vectors, including activation functions, divergence metrics, and update rules.

## 1. Value Vector Space

Identity vectors exist in a high-dimensional preference space:

V_k ∈ ℝ^d

Each vector represents a latent moral preference, affective orientation, or cognitive tendency.

---

## 2. Superposition Equation

Identity is modeled as a weighted sum of multiple value vectors:

I(t) = Σ (α_k(t) · V_k)

Weights α_k change dynamically depending on memory, context, and affective states.

---

## 3. Activation Dynamics

Weight updates follow a generalized activation function:

dα_k/dt = g(M(t), C(t), H(t))

Where:

- `M(t)` = memory state  
- `C(t)` = context  
- `H(t)` = affective/emotional state  

This expresses how identity evolves through time.

## 4. Divergence Metric

Identity drift magnitude is defined as:

D = ‖ I(t + Δt) – I(t) ‖

This measures the rate at which an agent's identity changes.

## 5. Stability Conditions

Identity is stable when:

- activation variance is low,  
- memory decay is slow,  
- contextual noise is limited, and  
- moral conflict remains small.

These conditions provide mathematical grounding for identity superposition theory and predict long-term identity trajectories.
