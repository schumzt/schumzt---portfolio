# 3. Episodic–Semantic Reconstruction Model (ESRM)

## 3.1 Overview
The **Episodic–Semantic Reconstruction Model (ESRM)** describes how a cognitive system retrieves,
compresses, and reconstructs memory by blending episodic traces with semantic structures.  
Rather than treating episodic memory as isolated events and semantic memory as static facts, ESRM 
suggests that both systems operate as a coupled reconstruction engine that dynamically re-generates 
"meaningful episodes" rather than retrieving raw past states.

This model assumes:

- episodic traces are fragmentary and context-dependent  
- semantic layers serve as stabilizing attractors  
- reconstruction is *generative*, not *extractive*  
- the identity vector provides weighting for relevance  
- context noise and attentional state modulate fidelity  

The model provides a framework for analyzing how humans (and memory-augmented AI systems) form coherent
narratives from incomplete information.



## 3.2 Architecture Components

### 1. Episodic Trace Units (ETUs)
Minimal fragments representing:

- sensory impressions  
- emotional markers  
- temporal anchors  
- environmental context  
- self-state markers (intent, perspective, motivation)

ETUs are not complete memories; they are sub-symbolic fragments.



### 2. Semantic Scaffold Network (SSN)
A high-stability structure built from:

- conceptual knowledge  
- patterns recognized across experiences  
- language-encoded schemas  
- culturally learned frameworks  
- personal identity definitions  

SSN acts as an attractor landscape that "pulls" episodic fragments into interpretable form.



### 3. Reconstruction Engine (R)
A generative process:

- integrates ETUs with SSN  
- fills missing gaps using probabilistic priors  
- restructures episodes to maintain identity-consistency  
- compresses redundancy  
- aligns narrative with current self-model  

`R` creates the final reconstructed memory representation.



### 4. Identity Vector (I)
A dynamic high-dimensional representation of:

- personal values  
- long-term beliefs  
- emotional preference structure  
- moral weighting  
- self-related priors  

The Identity Vector guides reconstruction by assigning relevance weights to episodic inputs.



## 3.3 Core Reconstruction Equation

Memory Reconstruction Output \( M_r \):

\[
M_r(t) = R(\; ETU(t) \;\oplus\; SSN \;\oplus\; I(t) \;\oplus\; N_c(t)\;)
\]

Where:

- \( ETU(t) \) – episodic fragments  
- \( SSN \) – semantic scaffold  
- \( I(t) \) – identity-weighted relevance  
- \( N_c(t) \) – contextual noise  
- \( R \) – reconstruction operator  

The reconstruction is not a copy of the past – it is a *self-consistent generation* constrained by identity and semantics.



## 3.4 Noise & Fidelity Dynamics

### **1. Contextual Noise (Nc)**  
Noise increases when:

- emotional arousal is high  
- attention was low during encoding  
- time delay increases  
- conflicting semantic priors exist  

### **2. Fidelity (F)**  
Defined as:

\[
F = 1 - \frac{||M_r(t) - M_r(t-\Delta)||}{||M_r(t)||}
\]

High fidelity means stable reconstruction across time.

### **3. Stability Conditions**  
Fidelity is maximized when:

- semantic scaffold is strong  
- identity vector is coherent  
- episodic fragments are dense  
- contextual noise is low  



## 3.5 Reconstruction Profiles

Different types of reconstructed memory emerge depending on the weighting parameters.

### **1. Identity-Dominant Reconstruction**
When \( I(t) \) weight is high:

- self-consistent  
- narratively clean  
- emotionally filtered  
- bias-reinforced  
- highly stable  

### **2. Semantic-Dominant Reconstruction**
When SSN weight is high:

- abstracted  
- generalized  
- lesson-like  
- schema-aligned  

### **3. Episodic-Dominant Reconstruction**
When ETU weight is high:

- vivid  
- sensory-dense  
- emotional resonance high  
- reconstruction less stable  

### **4. Noise-Dominant Reconstruction**
When \( N_c(t) \) dominates:

- distorted  
- fragmented  
- confabulated  
- low fidelity  
- high variance  



## 3.6 Identity Consistency Principle

Reconstructed memories must remain compatible with the system’s identity vector:

\[
R(M_r) \rightarrow \min(||I(t) - I_{pred}||)
\]

Meaning the memory is shaped to minimize conflict between:

- current identity  
- predicted identity trajectory  

This explains why memories change over time while still feeling “true.”



## 3.7 Applications

### **In Humans**
- narrative self-construction  
- emotional memory bias  
- PTSD intrusion / distortion patterns  
- attachment-driven reconstructions  
- cultural memory shaping  

### **In AI Systems**
- long-term conversational coherence  
- identity-weighted memory retrieval  
- persona stability  
- context-adaptive recall  
- hallucination suppression via scaffold anchoring  



## 3.8 Summary
The Episodic–Semantic Reconstruction Model shows that memory is an active generative process—  
not passive retrieval. Episodic fragments supply raw material, semantic scaffolds impose structure,  
identity vectors supply weighting, and contextual noise modulates variance.

The final reconstructed memory is a **self-consistent, meaning-optimized narrative**  
that evolves as identity evolves.
