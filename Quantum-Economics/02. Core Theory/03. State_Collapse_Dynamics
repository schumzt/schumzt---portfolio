# State Collapse Dynamics  
## How Identity Becomes Action

The Identity Wave exists in superposition until a decision must be made.

At that moment, the wave **collapses** into a specific behavioral state.

### Collapse Trigger
A collapse is triggered by:
- external pressure  
- internal conflict reaching threshold  
- social evaluation  
- time constraints  
- emotional overload  

### Conceptual Model

\[
\Psi(t) \xrightarrow{\text{decision}} \text{Behavior}(t)
\]

The behavior is *not* the identity itself.  
It is the **collapsed expression** of deeper waves.

### Why Collapse Happens
Because the human system cannot remain indefinitely in superposed potential states.  
Life forces action, and action forces collapse.

### Economic Significance
Markets are built from collapsed actions:
- trades  
- spending  
- saving  
- investing  
- risk-taking  

But these actions are merely the **surface-level outputs**  
of deep identity waves interacting and collapsing continuously.

Understanding collapse dynamics allows us to model:
- impulsive purchases  
- panic selling  
- economic bubbles  
- shifts in consumer confidence  
in a structured, predictable way.
